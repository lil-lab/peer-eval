# Peer Evaluation Process

This repository provides the peer evaluation procedure used in CS 5740 Spring 2021 at Cornell Tech. This evaluation scheme was created by [Michael Clarkson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~clarkson/). The instructions and form were cloned (with slight modifications) from [CS 3110 at Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2019fa/proj/peer_eval.html). The code in this repository is a re-implementation.

The processing script is designed to work with a CSV file generated by a Google form. The survey results are collected using a form:  
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdc5LcqRSJkCqf10r_9WKTc_gtLtYxTdncPDm4mviAyhbNFzA/viewform

The instructions in `instructions.md` explain the process. 

The script is designed to work with a Gradescope YML file for group information, and output Canvas CSV file that can be imported direclty into Canvas. Other formats require minimal modifications.
